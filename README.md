# WindRanger Engineering Community Values
The WindRanger Engineering Community values contain aspirational elements and expectational components.

## WindRanger Engineering Community
Members of WindRanger directly involved in the engineering disciple, either in direct practice or indirectly in a facilitation capacity. 

### Change Process

#### Clarification 
To ask a clarifying question or begin a more general values related discussion, raise a GitHub Issue using the `Question` or `Discussion` template.

#### Amendments
For any correction or amendment to the value, create a fork, make a branch with the changes then raise a Pull Request (as you'll need a good number of approvals before being able to merge, go ahead and add WindRanger-core members as reviewers too!).

## Values

### Act intentionally 
Awareness of yourself, the task you are undertaking, the context of your action and the effect you intend as the outcome.

We embrace the additional responsibility that follows from ownership, the weight of expectation with the autonomy to execute efficiently.
