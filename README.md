# WindRanger Engineering Community Values
The WindRanger Engineering Community values contain aspirational elements and expectational components.

## WindRanger Engineering Community
Members of WindRanger directly involved in the engineering disciple, either in direct practice or indirectly in a facilitation capacity. 

### Change Process

#### Clarification 
To ask a clarifying question or begin a more general values related discussion, raise a GitHub Issue using the `Question` or `Discussion` template.

#### Amendments
For any correction or amendment to the value, create a fork, make a branch with the changes then raise a Pull Request (as you'll need a good number of approvals before being able to merge, go ahead and add WindRanger-core members as reviewers too!).

## Values

### Act intentionally 
Awareness of yourself, the task you are undertaking, the context of your action and the effect you intend as the outcome.

We embrace the additional responsibility that follows from ownership, the weight of expectation with the autonomy to execute efficiently.

### Open & honest communication
Clear, concise and relevant dialogue.

We convey pertinent details with colleagues in a timely and respectful manner, while also engaging meaningfully in community discussions.

### Diligence 
Holding ourselves and our colleagues accountable to high standards of work.

We seek elegant long term solutions to problems, over short term fixes.

### Delivery
Before a product is fully realised it is merely intangible hope.

We navigate the troubled waters of creation, guiding our product all the way to being a shipped and valuable product.

### Curiosity
A spark that drives the self-motivated mind along the path of continual acquisition and improvement of knowledge, skills and understanding,

We identify and pursue opportunities to improve ourselves professionally and personally.
