# WindRanger Engineering Community Values
The WindRanger Engineering Community values contain aspirational elements and expectational components.

## WindRanger Engineering Community
Members of WindRanger directly involved in the engineering disciple, either in direct practice or indirectly in a facilitation capacity. 

### Change Process

#### Clarification 
To ask a clarifying question or begin a more general values related discussion, raise a GitHub Issue using the `Question` or `Discussion` template.

#### Amendments
For any correction or amendment to the value, create a fork, make a branch with the changes then raise a Pull Request (as you'll need a good number of approvals before being able to merge, go ahead and add WindRanger-core members as reviewers too!).
